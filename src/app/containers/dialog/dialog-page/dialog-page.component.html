    <h3>Develop across all platforms</h3>
    <p>
      Learn one way to build applications with Angular and reuse your code and
      abilities to build apps for any deployment target. For web, mobile web,
      native mobile and native desktop.
    </p>

    <h3>Speed &amp; Performance</h3>
    <p>
      Achieve the maximum speed possible on the Web Platform today, and take it
      further, via Web Workers and server-side rendering. Angular puts you in
      control over scalability. Meet huge data requirements by building data
      models on RxJS, Immutable.js or another push-model.
    </p>

    <h3>Incredible tooling</h3>
    <p>
      Build features quickly with simple, declarative templates. Extend the
      template language with your own components and use a wide array of
      existing components. Get immediate Angular-specific help and feedback with
      nearly every IDE and editor. All this comes together so you can focus on
      building amazing apps rather than trying to make the code work.
    </p>

    <h3>Loved by millions</h3>
    <p>
      From prototype through global deployment, Angular delivers the
      productivity and scalable infrastructure that supports Google's largest
      applications.
    </p>

    <h3>What is Angular?</h3>

    <p>
      Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the
      web. Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to
      end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development
      challenges. Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on
      the web, mobile, or the desktop
    </p>

    <h3>Architecture overview</h3>

    <p>
      Angular is a platform and framework for building client applications in
      HTML and TypeScript. Angular is itself written in TypeScript. It
      implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript
      libraries that you import into your apps.
    </p>

    <p>
      The basic building blocks of an Angular application are NgModules, which
      provide a compilation context for components. NgModules collect related
      code into functional sets; an Angular app is defined by a set of
      NgModules. An app always has at least a root module that enables
      bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature modules.
