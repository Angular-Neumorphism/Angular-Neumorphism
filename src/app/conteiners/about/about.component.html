          Neomorphism is a quite new UI trend. It's kind of 'soft design' that uses
      mostly shadows to do things. Using a Neomorphism in real projects is quite
      challenging because of not very clear rules and accessibility issues. But
      despite this, Neomorphism is beautiful. So we've decided to create this
      open-source framework to do using Neomorphism easier for developers.

    <p>
      Now we're on the very first stage - creating design concepts for the
      components. Further, step by step, we're going to create independent
      reusable modules for each of them. Now, if you like some component fill
      free to use it styles from our GitHub repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      With huge love and respect, we've decided to use Angular Material as a
      base of our framework. So if you'll use any component be sure to
      install all required dependencies.
